    "#### Introducing arithmetic Expression Examples\n",
    "Arithmetic expressions are mathematical expressions that involve basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. They are used to perform calculations and manipulate numerical values. Here are some examples of arithmetic expressions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Addition:**\n",
    "   - Expression: `3 + 5`\n",
    "   - Result: 8\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Subtraction:**\n",
    "   - Expression: `10 - 7`\n",
    "   - Result: 3\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multiplication:**\n",
    "   - Expression: `4 * 6`\n",
    "   - Result: 24\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Division:**\n",
    "   - Expression: `15 / 3`\n",
    "   - Result: 5\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Complex Expression:**\n",
    "   - Expression: `(12 + 8) * 2 - (10 / 2)`\n",
    "   - Result: `(20) * 2 - 5 = 40 - 5 = 35`\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Using Variables:**\n",
    "   - You can use variables in arithmetic expressions. For example, if you have `x = 7` and `y = 3`, you can calculate `x + y`, which would result in `10`.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Parentheses:**\n",
    "   - Parentheses can be used to control the order of operations. For example, in the expression `5 * (3 + 2)`, the addition inside the parentheses is performed first, resulting in `5 * 5`, which equals 25.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Exponents:**\n",
    "   - Exponents are used to represent raising a number to a power. For example, `2^3` means 2 raised to the power of 3, which equals 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Modulus:**\n",
    "   - The modulus operator `%` calculates the remainder when one number is divided by another. For example, `10 % 3` equals 1 because 10 divided by 3 is 3 with a remainder of 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Combining Operations:**\n",
    "    - You can combine multiple arithmetic operations in a single expression. For example: `2 * (5 + 3) / 4 - 1`.\n",
